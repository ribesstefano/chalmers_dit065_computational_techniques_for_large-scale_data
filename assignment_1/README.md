# Assignment 1

## Points to Discuss

* Shall we measure the function itself or the process running the Python script?
  * Process: the function `compute_pi` accepts the parsed arguments and we would need to refactor the code
* Shall we use a bar plot for discrete `k` values or a continuous line? Or maybe both?
* What's the parallel and serial part of the algorithm? (needed for calculating Amdhal's law)
* How do we present our results? Overleaf? Plain txt?
